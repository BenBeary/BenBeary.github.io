              This was part of our first project for the class where we had to create brushes for a paint 
              program. I wanted to try and create a form of interactability to the program so I created functions 
              like sliders and buttons.

            Even though the editor took the most to create, I think the mirror toggles were probably the 
            best feature I made. The process was super simple in which I would take the user's current position 
            compared to the halfway point of the canvas and invert the position and have it draw there as well. I 
            ended up using this feature to make some really cool pieces of art.

                I also created multiple hotkeys for different commands like filling the canvas with 
                a color, numbers for different brushes, switch to complementary color, and switch between 
                rgb and grayscale colormodes.
