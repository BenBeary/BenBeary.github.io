           <p>
              I created an editor script for an assignment to reduce time in coding and also create 
              a visual display for what it will look like. The assignment was to create a 2D array 
              and make a bitmap out of numbers to represent what the bit's color would be. 
              
              <br> <br>
              My program would take the art you created and then print the neccessary code required 
              for the assignment. I did not fully create a script that worked, but I made it so you 
              could copy and paste the code into the person's script. 
              
              <br> <br>
              The main things I worked on for this assignment was improving the editor window compared 
              to previous editors I have made in the class. For the sliders, I cleaned up the over all 
              look to it and made the interaction more smooth with less jolting. One of the main things I 
              did was create an input system for the values where you could click on it and edit it with 
              keyboard numbers as you would in other softwares. 
              
              <br> <br>
              The Pallete System was also a fun one to make as it would add and remove colors that were 
              currently on the board and add a button to the editor and allow the user to switch between 
              colors quickly. It also can scale the pallete if the colors excede 9.

              <br> <br>
              The code printer was fun to make as it would create a string array that added all the numbers 
              in the grid array together and also create the code for the colors as well and then create a .txt 
              file and send it to the downloads folder.
              
              <br> <br>
              This was a really fun project I made for myself and am happy to say that it helped classmates with 
              creating their bitmaps faster.
