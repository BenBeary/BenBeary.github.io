              When going over the game in the playtest and unity build, there were no apparent 
              bugs or glitches found. Due to the game's simplicity, the likelihood of anything 
              going wrong was small. The real problem we had was the difficulty ramp as time went 
              on was not fully tested so after a certain time, the game because almost impossible to 
              keep playing as the interval of cars spawning is to low.

              The game at is current state is complete. The only real changes that would be made 
              are not related to core mechanics of what we had planned out. One of the main things we 
              thought to add was speed boost which could get you further ahead, but with no real way 
              of tracking how far the player has gone, we never got around to adding it.

              The main changes we did to the game since alpha was adding more car textures 
              and creating a parallax background. This was all really easy to do because the 
              game was consistently moving. We were able to reuse the script for the road movement 
              and just slow them down to create the desired affect.  <br> 
              <br> The textures were also really easy to do for me as I only had to make one spritesheet 
              per car type. I was able to reuse the shader that I made for the sedan and apply it to the 
              other car varients making different colors easy to make.
