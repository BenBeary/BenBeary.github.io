                We were tasked in creating an alphabet using only images and there had to be a theme to it. 
                The only real challenge I had with this assignment was aligning some images. There was not too 
                much creativity here unless I made my own images. The assignment was crudely done as the time 
                frame was short and I think I did alright for the time alotted.
