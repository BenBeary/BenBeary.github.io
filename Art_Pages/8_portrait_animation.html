              This was probably the most fun project in the school year as it
              let the student have creative freedom for how the video would look
              like. The only requirements were a theme, vector style image of a
              head, and tween animations. I thought my head cut-out turned out
              awesome. I had some trouble with adobe animate as it had been a
              while since I last used it. After a short break away from it, I
              was able to come back and figure out how to properly tween and
              create the video really quickly.
