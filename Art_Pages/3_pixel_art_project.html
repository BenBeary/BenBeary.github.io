              I've been working on another game for the spring semester of 2023 with
              a group for the game development club. I've been tasked with making pixel
              art for the game with an Indiana Jones theme to it. I mostly took this project
              on because I wanted to learn how to draw pixel art, but now I have been working
              on some parts of the coding as well. The team and I are still working on the game
              so all of these screenshots are early drafts of areas that will be in the game.

              I was able to learn more about Unity 2D and figured out how
              lightning, layers, and tilemaps work and have been able to create
              a somewhat enchanting world with it.
