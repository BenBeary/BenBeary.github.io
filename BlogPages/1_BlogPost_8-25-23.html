              The Game I ended up wanting to play from the Arcade Cabinet was
              <em>Dynablaster - Bomber Man<em> which seems to be a clone of the
              original Bomber Man game. The player controls were very simple as
              the only thing to do was move and place bombs. One of the main things
              that I ended up learning from this experience was that there was a coop
              version of this game. When I played the original version in the arcades,
              It was always player verse player and having a coop version like this seems
              like it would have caused more frustration and trolling than working together.

              The start-up of the game was not what I expected at all. When the game first started,
              I thought it had crashed, but in reality, the game was doing a ram check to make sure
              the game files were ok. I don't use emulators often, but I never thought it would do
              exactly what the game would have done in an arcade box. The sound quality almost felt like
              it was worse than what it was originally, but since it's a knock-off I can't be too sure.

              I think the main difference I would have experienced between an arcade machine
              versus this emulator would be faster movements as a joystick will always feel
              better in movement with these types of games. Unlike my childhood, I would probably
              not play this game again as playing against other people is more fun in my opinion.
