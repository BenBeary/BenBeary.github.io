              I think this class was an amazing learning experience for me. During my time developing 
              two different games within this class, I was able to learn way more about Ienumerators 
              along with finding out how to transfer data between scenes more efficiently. I also learned 
              some new built-in functions and the best way to use them. <br> <br>

              The final presentations for my group went amazingly as we all had put a lot of effort into 
              the game making it one of the hottest ticket items within the presentation. We got a lot of 
              good feedback praising the game and ideas for how to improve.

              The class materials and reads on game design were helpful and knowledgeable. There were 
              some pockets of information I had already learned before this, but that is mostly because 
              I am at a senior-level education taking beginner-level classes. The most interesting topic 
              I did learn from this class was DMA and all the data behind making a good video game.

              I think the course as a whole was laid out very well with the learning about game design being 
              in the start and the transition to actually practicing game design in the later half. The 
              only thing I wish for would be a point in time in the class where the programmers got taught 
              some of the basics of coding in Unity.
