              The First game we ended up playing was <strong>Cheat</strong> or also known as
              <strong>Bullshit</strong>. We played a couple of rounds before actually logging any
              results so people unfamilar, such as myself, could learn and figure out how the game
              is played.

            <p style="color: black;">
              We didn't want to think too hard for another game that could support 5 people, so
              we went with <strong>Go Fish!</strong> for our second game. There was a little confusion
              while playing as most people were only used to playing the game with 2 people, but everyone
              figured it out in the end and the game turned out quite fun with everyone getting at least 
              one set of pairs.
