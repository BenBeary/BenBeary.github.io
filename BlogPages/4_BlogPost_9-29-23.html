              For this last lab, we were assigned into pairs where we went through a catalogue of 
              different games from outside and inside of class. I want to mainly focus on the games 
              my partner Ryan and I ended up playing from the in-class made games because they are 
              going to be the most relevant towards us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with some of the end-of-the-semester-made games and compare and contrast 
              mostly because they had some of the most thought-out designs and polish. The two games 
              we ended up playing were <strong>Horai</strong> and <strong>Die in Dungeon</strong> 
              which were two amazing games that focused on two different aspects of MDA.

          <p>
            Starting with Horai, we are put into a very aesthetically pleasing world with a flower in 
            the middle and the only goal is to change through the seasons to manage the temperature 
            of the game. Not much mechanics-wise here, but it is made up through the incredible detail 
            put into each season along with background animals that would pop in from time to time. 
            Between watching and playing this game, There wasn't much going on as the mechanics of the 
            game were thin and it was mostly made to be looked at.

              Comparing this to Die in Dungeon, you get a game that focuses heavily on complex and 
              innovative mechanics for a turn-based fighter game using dice as your main form of attack 
              that can combo with other dice to give the player better attacks, defenses, or healing 
              based on the pattern you set them in. Even though this game doesn't have as beautiful 
              aesthetics as Horai did, it still created a very nice art style for itself with fewer 
              pixels needed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              
              There was a difference between playing and watching for this one as both 
              Ryan and I had different play styles for how we progressed and upgraded our dice and 
              character. Being able to watch someone else play and figure out combos to use, you can get 
              lost very quickly as you never know what they are doing or what they are trying to accomplish.

            <p>
              Moving backward, I want to talk about Desert Racing Syndicate which was under one of the 
              month-long project games that we are heading into right now. I think this game sets an 
              example of showing that getting started with game development does not have to be about 
              creating a breathtaking game with an amazing story and complex mechanics but can be as 
              simple as racing around a track with your friends. Even though Desert Racing Syndicate 
              is nowhere near the polish of Horai or Die In Dungeon, it is still a game and a good 
              starting point for people trying to enter and learn more about the game development 
              industry and the process of making a game in general.
