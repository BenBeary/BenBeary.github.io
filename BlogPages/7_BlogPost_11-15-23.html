              I forgot which jackbox version we played on, but I do remember that it was a t-shirt drawing
              competition and the spooky-horror trivia game. Some of the main mechanics that were used
              during the t-shirt drawing games we played were drawing, obviously, and also creating
              random prompts. There was no actual prompt to go off of while making the shirts and
              everything had to be paired with each other after it was already made or written. It is
              an overall simple game mechanic that can lead to some very funny results. Since it was
              a competition-style game, the audience had more influence in the game as the shirt
              that won would get points and the audience could heavily sway the vote.

              I was one of the people in the game during that session and got third place overall. 
              I took a back seat for the horror trivia game and got to watch fellow classmates get 
              slaughtered by answering wrong. The main form of interaction from the audience in this 
              game involved voting for who would get murdered. The audience did have a cash prize, but 
              it didn't count towards anything in the end. I ended up getting around a quarter of the 
              questions right and I'm glad that I didn't get put into the spotlight like the contestants 
              did.
