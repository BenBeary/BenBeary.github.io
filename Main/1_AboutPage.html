              <p>
                Ben is a 21-year-old male studying at San Jose State
                University for a BFA in Digital Media Arts. Ever since
                high school, they have dreamed for a career in the games
                industry. During his time in high school, he learned multiple
                coding languages such as Javascript, C#, C++ while also
                learning art programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Maya.

                After finishing high school at the start of the 2020 pandemic,
                they moved on towards attending a community college where he
                would take the next two years earning transfer credits for his
                GE and then transfer to a college. During this time his knack
                for game design fell under as his motivation plummeted during
                the pandemic. Ben still worked on improving their art skills,
                but not with the same vigor he had back in high school. After
                finishing his GE courses during the spring of 2022, Ben transferred
                to San Jose State and was able to gain some motivation to start
                working on game design once more. They joined a Game Design Club
                that was on campus and has been making games with other people.
                Since then, he has been a part of the making of three different
                games with one being their very own side project.
