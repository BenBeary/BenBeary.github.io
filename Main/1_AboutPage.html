                My name is Ben Beary and I am studying at San Jose State University for a BFA 
                in Digital Media Arts. Ever since high school, I have dreamed of a career in 
                the games industry. During my time in high school, I learned multiple coding 
                languages such as Javascript, C#,  and C++ while also learning art programs 
                such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Maya. 
                <br> <br>
                After finishing high school at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I moved on 
                towards attending a community college where I would take the next two years 
                earning transfer credits for my GE and then transfer to a college. During this 
                time my knack for game design fell under as my motivation plummeted during the 
                pandemic. I still worked on improving my art skills, but not with the same 
                vigor I had back in high school. After finishing my GE courses in the spring 
                semester of 2022, I transferred to San Jose State and rekindled my motivation 
                to start working on game design once more. I ended up joining a Game Design 
                Club that was on campus and have been making games with other people. Since 
                then, I have been a part of the making of three different games with one being 
                a solo side project. 
                <br> <br>
                Now in 2023, I have been able to work on my skills and create better designs 
                for games with well-thought-out coding structures. Each year I have been able 
                to carve out a timeline and career goals that I want to accomplish here at San 
                Jose State.
